CanTrip is a modern and convenient way for travelers to efficiently create, plan, and organize their trips. For those who plan trips beforehand and want to find events and attractions nearby, this is the mobile app for you! Input your trip data, add your reservations, and get guided recommendations for fun places to visit and events to attend to make the most of your trip!

### Schedule
##### We, as a team, completed the design and programming of CanTrip within five weeks. We broke down our app into 5 sizeable checkpoints and worked with Professor Paranthaman and CS4520 TAs to improve and revise our app every week.

#### Checkpoint 1: Prototyping and Overall Layout
##### We used the MoSCOW (Must Have, Should Have, Could Have, Would Have) principles to decide how to break down and prioritize CanTrip.
Digital Prototype: https://marvelapp.com/77a36bb

#### Checkpoint 2: User-centric Input
Home Screen: User can see list of trips (M)
User can create a new trip by clicking on the ‘+’ Add Button (M)
Add Trip Screen: User enters starting point/destination of trip (M)
User enters duration dates of trip (M)

* Not completed due to similarities to other functionality already completed, or we did not feel it necessary to include it in the checkpoint because of similarity to already completed functionality

#### Final Checkpoint: Final Application/API Integration

Add user feedback
App reflections and analysis

### Overall
Working as a team to develop CanTrip was a rewarding (yet intense) experience. We were able to integrate APIs and utilize Firebase Database to make our app a success.
